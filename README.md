# Loggregator Messages

This gem is no longer used. Refer to the [loggregator_emitter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator_emitter) to see a Ruby implementation of the loggregator protobuffer messages.

Support for loggregator log messages is now provided by the [go cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli).
